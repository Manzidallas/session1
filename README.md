## Project Collection: Beginner Python Programs

This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly Python projects that cover fundamental programming concepts, ideal for anyone looking to strengthen their Python skills. Each program is designed to introduce a specific skill or technique and can be expanded for further practice.

### Projects Included

1. **Simple Calculator** 🧮  
   A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two inputs and an operator to return the calculated result. This project introduces basic input handling and control flow.

2. **Check Even or Odd** 🔢  
   A Python program to determine if a given number is even or odd. Using simple modulus logic, this project illustrates conditional statements and basic input/output operations.

3. **Display Maximum Number in a List** 📈  
   A program that identifies and displays the maximum value from a list of numbers. This project showcases list handling, iteration, and comparison techniques.

4. **String Length Finder** 📝  
   Returns the length of a string or text input, allowing users to measure text size easily. This project demonstrates string manipulation and introduces the use of built-in functions.

5. **Reverse a String** 🔄  
   A program that reverses a given string, showcasing different string handling methods in Python and introducing slicing for easy string manipulation.

6. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Advanced)** 🎮  
   An advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where the player competes against the computer. This project incorporates randomization, control flow, and an indefinite game loop, allowing the user to continue playing until they choose to quit.

7. **Number Guessing Game** 🔢  
   A guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a set range. This project involves random number generation, user input validation, and conditional feedback to create an interactive experience.
